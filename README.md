# automation_project
 i have created the aws infrastructure namely,ec2 instances,security group, IAM role and and a s3 bucket.
 then i have updated the system
 i have tired to check whether apache2 server is installed or not,if not installed i have made it to install.
 and i have enabled the apache server.
 whenever we use apache2 it creates lot of logs,so we need to move all this logs to an aws s3 bucket.
 i have mentioned the the script for moving  the apache logs to  s3 bucket.
 and this happnes everyday o.
 so we need to automate it .
 weh achieved it using cron jobs.
 task 3 /automation v0.2 includes the script for automaating the process.
